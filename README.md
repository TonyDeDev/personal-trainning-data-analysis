# 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Progress & Training Analysis Dashboard

This project explores my **personal gym progress** through data tracking, focusing on trends in training **frequency, work rate, and performance** over multiple years (2022–2024).  
The analysis highlights how my training structure, exercise selection, and work rate evolved over time — using both **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** and **Power BI** for visualization.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

- Data analysis of multi-year gym logs (2022–2024)
- Comparison of training frequency vs. work rate (intensity)
- Visualization of lift-specific progress (e.g., Bench Press, Lat Pulldown)
- Correlation between training consistency and strength development
- Integration of **Power BI dashboards** for visual exploration

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- In **2022**, training frequency was high, but progress was limited — possibly due to less structured programming and form development.
- From **2023 onward**, frequency decreased but **correlation with work rate strengthened**, reflecting improved technique and training focus.
- Despite fewer recorded weeks in later years, overall trends show **steady improvement in lift efficiency** and intensity management.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python - Pandas** for data cleaning and early analysis  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive exploration and documentation  
- **Power BI** for dashboard creation and visualization  
- **GitHub** for project version control and sharing

## 📈 Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates how **structured progression, improved form, and intensity management** can outweigh pure training frequency.  
While 2022 showed weak correlation between work rate and frequency, data from 2023–2024 revealed a stronger alignment — emphasizing the value of **quality over quantity**.  

Even with gaps in data (due to at-home training phases), the insights provide a clear direction:  
**Continue building intensity and consistency for optimal progress.**
